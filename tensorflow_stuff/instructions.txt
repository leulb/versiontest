In order to save the model to github while following it's file size limit of 1MB, I had to separate the model into its actual model and its weights
In order to load it into python, and test it, you're going to need to use the shell and use these commands:
import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.models import model_from_json
def getPrediction(model, img_path):
  img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size = (224, 224))
  img = image.img_to_array(img)
  img = np.expand_dims(img, axis = 0)
  arr = model.predict_classes(img)
  prdNum = arr[0][0]
  if prdNum == 0:
    return "Hollenbeck"
  else:
    return "Science"
jFile = open('FirstModel.json','r') #Assuming that your common directory is in tensorflow_stuff
jModel = jFile.read()
jFile.close()
model = model_from_json(jModel)
model.load_weights('FirstModelWeights.h5')

Then, in order to test it on one of our images, simply use:
getPrediction(model, <filepath of one of the images we have of either buildings>)
