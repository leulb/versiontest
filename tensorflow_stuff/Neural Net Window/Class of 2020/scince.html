  <p class="buldings">the science center houses some of Wittenberg's most popular majors in the departments of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, math, and computer science. It is also home to cooperative programs in engineering, environmental science, marine biology, nursing, and occupational therapy with leading research universities. The 141,025 square-foot, technologically rich structure also contains vast classroom and laboratory space, including new cell and microbiology labs, organic chemistry labs, and neurobiology and physiology labs, so that students from all disciplines can experience hands-on learning.</p>

<p class="buldings">tThe beautiful David L. Hobson Atrium connects the original 1966 building with its new 45,000-square-foot addition, and the center as a whole offers unlimited avenues for exploration, creativity and scientific inquiry. Located on the ground floor of the science center, Simply-To-Go is a common stop for students in between classes or after getting out of lab. Coffee as well as breakfast and lunch items are offered there during the day.
