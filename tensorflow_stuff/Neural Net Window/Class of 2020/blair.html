Nationally recognized, Wittenberg's teacher education program, The Springfield-Wittenberg Teacher Institute, strives to develop educators who are not only skillful and knowledgeable, but also committed to the growth and well being of their students and their communities. In addition, Upward Bound, a program to help potential first-generation college students develop skills to succeed academically and personally in high school and ideally through college, is also housed in Blair.</p>
